This is a *"Indian Traffic Road Simulator"*, created under the project COP290 - Design Practices in Computer Science

![Output Sample](https://github.com/CRekkaran/Design-Practices-COP290/blob/master/Road%20Traffic%20Simulation/demo/simulationTraffic_final.mkv)

Road traffic is depicting accidents with a probability of 8%, rule breaking by jumping the read-light, bikes often stand on the zebra crossing; these are some must have parameters for a road to be simulated. Some times, cars or any vehicle decelerates with no prior reason which is also present in this simulation with a probability of 7%.

Here,all vehicles are created as an objects with some specific Maxspeed, acceleration, color and decelaration at the time of encountering the red light; and these parameters can be modified using the config file.

How to run : 
	
	execute make ; make run on the terminal

config.ini : 
	Takes parameters :- 
	
	Simulation Id | Road length | Road width | Position of Red Light | Maximum speed of car | Maximum speed of bike | Maximum speed of auto | Maximum speed of truck | Acceleration of car | Acceleration of bike | Acceleration of auto | Acceleration of truck | Simulation time gaps for red and green signal
